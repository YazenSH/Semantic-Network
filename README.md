# Semantic-Network
 This project demonstrates how semantic networks represent knowledge, particularly in a hospital domain. Employing NetworkX and Matplotlib, it visualizes relationships. Its menu-based interface enables users to manipulate nodes, aiding comprehension of semantic networks for problem-solving and data modeling in AI and data science.
